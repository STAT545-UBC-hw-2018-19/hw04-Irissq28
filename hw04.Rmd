# Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)

**Problem**: *You have data in one 'shape' but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.*

**Solution**: *Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that is possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.*

## Activity #1 Cheatsheet of `reshape2` functions and `tidyr` functions

### Commonly used functions in `reshape2` and `tidyr`

| `reshape2` | `tidyr` |
|---------------|---------------|
| `melt` | `gather`  |
| `dcast` | `spread` |
| NA | `separate` |
| NA | `unite` |

### An Introductin to `reshape2` and wide/long format data

`reshape2` is an R package which makes it easy to transform data between wide and long formats.

Wide format data has a column fo reach variable, which is clear to read, For example:

```{r Wide format data example}
##         A          B       C
## 1       23        11      65
## 2       29        10      79
## 3       59        8       83
```

While for long format data, Generally speaking, one column(vairable) contains all variables the other column(value) is the matched data.For example: 
But long-format data unnecessarily only two columns, and in reality, you need long format data more commonly than wide format data, such as `ggplot2` requires long format data.

```{r Long format data example}
##    vairable    value
## 1        A        23     
## 2        A        29
## 3        A        59
## 4        B        11
## 5        B        10
## 6        B         8
## 7        C        65
## 8        C        79
## 9        C        83
```

 
### `melt` in `reshape2` package

`melt` takes wide format data into long format data.

```{r setting up}
# setting up
library(gapminder)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(grid)
library(gridBase)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

By default, `melt` treat all columns with numeric values as variable with values. if you want to control the cloumn names in the long format data, try `id.vars` and `variable.name`, also `value.name`

```{r melt function}
#original `gapminder` data frame is wide format data
wideformat <- head(gapminder)

# 'melted' has 18 rows, since 6 rows in original `wideformat` data frame, and there are three variables `lifeExp`,`pop`,`gdpPercap`
melted <- melt(wideformat, id.vars = c('country','continent','year'),
               variable.name = 'variable', value.name ='value')

head(melted,n=9)

tt <- ttheme_default(
  # Use the smaller text size
  # Alternate the row fill colours
  core = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6),
              bg_params=list(fill=c("lightyellow","lightblue"))), 
  # Change column header to white text and grey background
  colhead = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6)), 
  rowhead = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6)), rows=NULL)

melted_table <- tableGrob(melted,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
original_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(original_table, melted_table,
             nrow = 1, top = "Application of the melt function")
```

### `dcast` in `reshape2` package

`cast` functions can change long format data into wide format data. In `reshape2`, there are many `cast` functions, for example,`dcast` --- returns a data frame, `acast` -- returns vector, matrix or array. Since we commonly work with data.frame objects, we'll explore `dcast` function.

```{r dcast function}
# combine 'country','continent' and 'year' in each dimension with '+', 
# and separate dimension with a '~'
casted <- dcast(melted, country + continent + year ~ variable)
head(casted,n=3)

melted_table <- tableGrob(melted,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
casted_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(melted_table, casted_table,
             nrow = 1, top = "Application of the dcast function")
```
 
If it isn't clear of what happened here, then take a look of this illustration:
the blue box area indicates ID variable that we want to represent individual rows, and the red box area represents variable name that we want to swing into different column names.

<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-Irissq28/blob/master/figure/illustration%20of%20the%20dcast%20function.png" width="700" height="600"/>


Another case not mentioned in our previous examples, and it's might to make mistake here. If you cast a dataset in which there is more than one value per data cell, For example, we won't take 'country' as an ID variable. 

if we executed the `dcast`line. Here comes an error:
Aggregation function missing: defaulting to length

```{r illustration of why the mistake happened}
# To illustrate the mistake it may casued, here I filtered 2 continents,
# Use filter 
melted1 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent %in% c('Asia','Europe')) %>%
  melt(id.vars = c('country','continent','year'), 
       variable.name = 'variable', value.name ='value')
#dcast(melted1, continent + year ~ variable)
```

Then the output data is not correct, since there are many countries in each continent, which means when you cast your data and there are many multiple values per cell, to get the correct output data, you still need to tell `dcast` how to aggregate the data. For example, you want to take the `mean` , `median` or the `sum ` of variables.

```{r solution to the mistake}
#  pass the na.rm = TRUE through the ... argument to remove NA values
dcast(melted1, continent + year ~ variable, 
      fun.aggregate = mean , na.rm = TRUE)
```

### An Introductin to `tidyr`

`tidyr` package provides fundamental functions for cleaning, processing and manipulating data.

`tidyr`

  * gather( )
  * spread( )
  * separate( )
  * unite( )

### `gather` in `tidyr` package

`gather` takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs: it makes wide data longer.

To explore the `gather` funcitons, we still use the previous data frame. Based on the illustrations of `melt`, the `gather` is much easier to understand, they all make wide data format longer.

```{r gather function}
library(tidyr)
# `casted` is a wide format data frame we used before
# We are going to turn it into long format data
longfd <- casted %>%
  gather(key, values, c(4:6))
# I identified the columns to collapse with a series of integers, 4:6 describes the fourth to sixth columns of the data frame.

casted_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
longfd_table <- tableGrob(longfd,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(casted_table, longfd_table,
             nrow = 1, top = "Application of the gather function")
```

### `spread` in `tidyr` package

`spread` takes two columns (key & value) and spreads in to multiple columns, it makes long data wider. Still we used last `longdf` data frame. Based on the illustrations of `dcast`, the `spreak` is also easy to understand. 

```{r spread function}
# turn the long format data into wide format data
spread_data <- spread(longfd, key, values)

longfd_table <- tableGrob(longfd,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
spread_table <- tableGrob(spread_data,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(longfd_table, spread_table,
             nrow = 1, top = "Application of the spread function")
```

### `separate` in `tidyr` package

`separate` can turn a single charachter into multiple columns by splitting a single variable whenever a seperator charachter appears. Many times a single column will capture mutiple varables, or even parts of a variable you don't just care about. 

By default, `separate` will split values wherever a non-alphanumeric character appears. Non-alphanumeric characters are characters that are neither a number nor a letter. For example, in the code below, separate() split the values of `lifeExp` at the decimal point.

```{r separate function 1}
sparate_data <- separate(casted, lifeExp, into = c("integer", "decimal point"))

casted_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
sparate_table <- tableGrob(sparate_data,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(casted_table, sparate_table,
             nrow = 2, top = "Application of the separate function")
```

If you also want to use a specific character to seperate a column, you can pass the character to the `sep` argument of `separate()`. For example.

```{r separate function 2}
# We used the data frame from `cast` functions in previous section.
# The purpose of this part is to show how to separate variable by a specific character, no practical meaning
separatelifeExp <- separate(casted, lifeExp, 
                            into = c("lifeExpinteger","lifeExp_decimal_point"),
                            remove = FALSE, convert = TRUE)
# remove = FALSE (maintain input column from output data frame.)
# convert = TRUE (convert anything that seems like it should be in another format to that other format, e.g. numeric to numeric) 

casted_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
separatelifeExp_table <- tableGrob(separatelifeExp,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(casted_table, separatelifeExp_table,
             nrow = 2, top = "Application of the separate function by using a specific character")
```

You can also pass an integer to sep, then `separate()` will interpret the integer at the position number(start at 1 at the far-left of the strings; negative value start at -1 at the far-right of the strings), For example, we use `sep = 2` to separate the last 2 digits of each year.

```{r separate function 3}
# We used the data frame from `cast` functions in previous section.
# The purpose of this part is to show how to separate variable by position(starts from 1)
separateyear <- separate(casted, year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)

casted_table <- tableGrob(wideformat,rows = NULL,theme = tt)
separateyear_table <- tableGrob(separateyear,rows = NULL,theme = tt)

grid.arrange(casted_table, separateyear_table,
             nrow = 2, top = "Application of the separate function by postion number")
```

### `unite` in `tidyr` package

`unite()` does the opposite of `separate()`, it combines multiple columns into a single column, just like `melt()` and `gather()` we mentioned before.

By default, `unite()` will place an underscore "_" between values from separate columns. If you would like to use a different separator, or no separator at all, pass the separator as a character string to 'sep'. For example, we use no separator, then pass "" to 'sep'. 

```{r unite function}
uniteyear <- unite(separateyear, "new", century, year, sep="", remove = TRUE)
# remove = TRUE (remove input column from output data frame.)

separateyear_table <- tableGrob(separateyear, rows = NULL, theme = tt)
uniteyear_table <- tableGrob(uniteyear, rows = NULL, theme = tt)

grid.arrange(separateyear_table, uniteyear_table,
             nrow = 2, top = "Application of the unite function")
```

# Join Prompts (join, merge, look up)

**Problem**: *You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.*

**Solution**: *Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.*

## Activity #1

*Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:*

*One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capitol city.*

*One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern hemisphere.*

### A second data frame

In this part, I used data available on [Gapminder's data](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) webpage, mainly focused on [Aged 15-24 employment rate](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), which describes the percentage of total population, age group 15-24, that has been employed during the given year.

```{r read csv}
employment_rate <- read.csv("/Users/Anan/Desktop/git/hw04-Irissq28/aged_15_24_employment_rate_percent.csv")
```

To get an overview of the **Aged 15-24 employment rate** database.

```{r an overview of the database}
head(employment_rate)
```

### Tidy the new data frame

We want to filter the **Aged 15-24 employment rate** in the year of 2007, then it's possible to find the relationship between gdpPercap and employment rate in 2007. From our previous discussion, we could use `gather` in `tidyr` package. After reshape the data, we now get a new dataframe.

```{r gather function of employment rate}
emprate_gathered <- employment_rate %>%
  gather(year, employment_rate, c(2:33))
head(emprate_gathered,n=6)
```

### left_join()

Use `filter()` function in `dplyr`, data in 2007 from `gapminder` and `employment rate` is both filtered. Now we joining them together. `left_join()` keeps everything from the left table and matches as much as it can from the right table.

```{r filter the two dataframe and left join}
gapminder2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
emprate_gathered2007 <- emprate_gathered %>%
  filter(year == "X2007")
left_2007 <- left_join(gapminder2007,emprate_gathered2007,by = "country")
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( left_2007, 12 ),theme = tt, rows = NULL),
             top = "Left join of gapminder and employment_rate in 2007")
```

### right_join()

And `right_join()` keeps everything from the right table and matches as much as it can from the left table.

```{r right join}
right_2007 <- right_join(gapminder2007,emprate_gathered2007,by = "country")
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( right_2007, 12 ),theme = tt, rows = NULL),
             top = "Right join of gapminder and employment_rate in 2007")
```

### full_join()

`full_join()` keeps all observations from both tables.

```{r full join}
full_2007 <- full_join(gapminder2007,emprate_gathered2007,by = "country")
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( full_2007, 12 ),theme = tt, rows = NULL),
             top = "Full join of gapminder and employment_rate in 2007")
```

### inner_join()

`Inner_join()` only keeps the observations that are similar between the two tables, So we are going to apply the data inner join table to explore the relationship between gdpPercap and employment rate aged 14-25 in the next part.

```{r inner join}
inner_2007 <- inner_join(gapminder2007,emprate_gathered2007,by = "country")
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( inner_2007, 12 ),theme = tt, rows = NULL),
             top = "Inner join of gapminder and employment_rate in 2007")
```

### Data visualization

We use the scatterplot to visualize the 'gdpPercap vs employment rate' in each continent in 2007, and it can be observed that gdpPercap increases with employment rate in Europe in 2007.

```{r gdpPercap vs employment rate in each continent in 2007}
inner_2007 %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, employment_rate, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "gdpPercap", y = "Aged 15-24 employment rate", 
       title = "gdpPercap vs employment rate in each continent in 2007") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

From the graph, it's compliance with previous analysis. So there might be a relationship between gdpPercap and employment rate.

```{r gdpPercap vs employment rate in Europe in 2007}
inner_2007 %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, employment_rate, size = pop)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(x = "gdpPercap", y = "Aged 15-24 employment rate", 
       title = "gdpPercap vs employment rate in Europe in 2007") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12))
```
